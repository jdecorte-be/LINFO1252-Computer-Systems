# LINFO1252-Computer-Systems

## Overview

This repository contains materials and assignments for the LINFO1252 Computer Systems course. The content is organized into several directories, each focusing on a specific topic within computer systems.

## Directory Structure

- **philo/**: Contains code and resources related to the "philosophers" problem, a classic synchronization challenge in computer science.
- **prodcons/**: Includes implementations and materials for the producer-consumer problem, which deals with synchronization between processes.
- **script/**: Houses various scripts used throughout the course assignments.
- **spinlock/**: Contains code pertaining to spinlock mechanisms, a type of lock used in multithreading to prevent race conditions.
